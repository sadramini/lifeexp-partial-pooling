title: "Bayesian Multilevel Regression with Partial Pooling: Life Expectancy and GDP"
format: html
---

## Motivation
We study how GDP per capita relates to life expectancy across countries and demonstrate the benefit of partial pooling for estimating country-specific baselines.

## Data
We use Our World in Data:
- life expectancy (outcome)
- GDP per capita (predictor)

We focus on a single year to isolate cross-country variation.

## Models
We compare:
1. Complete pooling: `y ~ log_gdp`
2. No pooling (fixed effects): `y ~ log_gdp + country`
3. Partial pooling (multilevel): `y ~ log_gdp + (1 | country)`

## Priors
We use weakly informative proper priors (documented in code).

## Results
Include:
- scatter + fitted line
- shrinkage plot
- LOO comparison
- posterior predictive checks

## Discussion
Explain:
- what α_i represents,
- how partial pooling shrinks α_i toward μ_α,
- why this stabilizes estimates,
- predictive comparison (LOO) as evaluation.

## Limitations
We model association, not causality.
